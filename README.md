# CeaserCipher_Tool

Task- “Implement Caesar Cipher Tool”

• Objective:-
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.




•	Implementation:-
1.	Make the python script & Run
2.	Save the Python Script in kali linux.
3.	Open a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, gedit, or any other editor).
4.	Copy the Python code provided above into the editor.
5.	Save the file with a .py extension 
Nano Ceaser¬_cipher_tool.py
 
5.	Make the Script Executable 
6.	Give execute permissions to the script file:
chmod +x Ceaser_cipher_tool.py

7.	Now you can run it :
Python3 Ceaser_cipher_tool.py
 
• Conclusion:-

•	The Caesar Cipher Tool is implemented successfully, providing functionality for both encryption and decryption of text using a user-defined shift value. The program ensures accurate results and offers a user-friendly experience.
