# CeaserCipher_Tool

Task- “Implement Caesar Cipher Tool”

• Objective:-
Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.




•	Implementation:-
1.	Make the python script & Run
2.	Save the Python Script in kali linux.
3.	Open a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, gedit, or any other editor).
4.	Copy the Python code provided above into the editor.
5.	Save the file with a .py extension 
Nano Ceaser¬_cipher_tool.py
 
5.	Make the Script Executable 
6.	Give execute permissions to the script file:
chmod +x Ceaser_cipher_tool.py

7.	Now you can run it :
Python3 Ceaser_cipher_tool.py
 
• Conclusion:-

•	The Caesar Cipher Tool is implemented successfully, providing functionality for both encryption and decryption of text using a user-defined shift value. The program ensures accurate results and offers a user-friendly experience.


#Task:  Password Strength Checker

• Objective: Build a Python program to evaluate password strength.
• Tools Required: Python, kali linux, Pycharm

✅ Steps to follow:
1. Check Password Criteria
We will check the following conditions:
•	At least 8 characters long.
•	Contains both uppercase and lowercase letters.
•	Contains at least one numeric character.
•	Contains at least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()).
________________________________________
2. Provide Feedback
•	Weak: If the password doesn't meet most of the criteria (e.g., less than 8 characters).
•	Moderate: If the password meets some of the criteria but not all.
•	Strong: If the password meets all criteria.
________________________________________
3. Save Output in a Log File
We will log the password evaluation (including feedback) in a file for record-keeping.


•	Implementation:-
1.	Make the python script in pycharm 
 
2.	Install Python
First, make sure you have Python installed on your Linux machine. Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed, but you can verify this by running the following command in the terminal:
‘python3 –version’

If Python isn't installed, you can install it using the package manager for your distribution:
•	For kali linux:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3
 
3.	Save the Python Script
4.	Open a text editor (e.g., nano, vim, gedit, or any other editor).
5.	Copy the Python code provided above into the editor.
6.	Save the file with a .py extension 
Nano password_strength_checker.py
 
7.	Make the Script Executable 
8.	Give execute permissions to the script file:
chmod +x password_strength_checker.py
 
9.	Now you can run it :
Python3 password_strength_checker.py
 
10.	Check the Saved Output in a File using command
Nano password_stregth_log.txt
 
•Conclusion:-
•The Password Strength Checker is a practical tool for evaluating password robustness. By analyzing passwords against predefined criteria, it encourages users to adopt stronger, more secure practices. The inclusion of a feedback system and logging ensures better security awareness and record-keeping, making it a valuable addition to personal and organizational cybersecurity measures.
